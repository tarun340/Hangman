# Hangman
Project Description:

The Hangman Game is a classic guessing game in which players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. In this project, we will create a Hangman game using the Python programming language.

The objective of this project is to build a fully functional Hangman game using Python. The game will be played in the console, where a player will have to guess a word by suggesting letters one at a time. The game will have a predefined list of words that the player can guess. The player will have a limited number of attempts to guess the word. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure will be drawn on the screen. Once the stick figure is complete, the game will end, and the player will lose.

The project will involve creating the following components:

1. A list of words from which the player will guess the word.
2. A function to randomly select a word from the list.
3. A function to display the partially completed word on the screen, with the correct guesses filled in and the incorrect guesses marked with an X.
4. A function to draw the stick figure on the screen based on the number of incorrect guesses.
5. A function to take input from the player and check if the input is a valid letter.
6. A function to check if the player's guess is correct and update the partially completed word and the stick figure accordingly.
7. A function to check if the game is over (either the player has guessed the word or the stick figure is complete).
